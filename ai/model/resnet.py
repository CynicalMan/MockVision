            more details, and possible values. By default, no pre-trained
            weights are used.
        progress (bool, optional): If True, displays a progress bar of the
            download to stderr. Default is True.
        num_classes (int, optional): number of output classes of the model (including the background)
        aux_loss (bool, optional): If True, it uses an auxiliary loss
        weights_backbone (:class:`~torchvision.models.ResNet101_Weights`, optional): The pretrained weights for the
